My name is Vishal Mishra. I'm a embedded software engineer and AI/ML enthusiast. I'm originally from Kolkata, India, but I moved to Germany in 2018.
I love learning new languages ( can speak 6 languages as of today : Hindi, English, German, Bengali, Kannada and Marwari ) , don't ask me HOW !! :D Takes a lot of toll on my brain to switch between languages.
Travelling is a part of my life which I admire. Been to 27 countries till now and still counting.......
